# CSS Responsive Grid

This is a responsive grid system that I made, based on the terminology of Bootstrap's grid system.
It is implemented using a simple Sass loop, and is customizable if you download the source code.
You have the ability to customize how many columns you want to be able to have per row (by default, it is 12, like Bootstrap).
You can also determine as many breakpoints as you would like.
By default, they are the same breakpoints as Bootstrap.
There is probably a better way, but for the time being, you will put your biggest breakpoint with the value of 'last'.
